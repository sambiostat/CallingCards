CallingCards.py:
        The warpped scripts for running all the folowing code.
        use option [--h] to see the help and usage.

Precutchr.py
        Used to 1) pre-filter data based on position count and 2) add 5^n bonus to positions with more than one insertions 3) partition data set into 22files based on chr
        Input: txt data with format "chromosome  position count".
Output: 24 txt format data for 24 chromosomes, sorted by position, 1st column is Chromosome and the 2nd column is the position, 3rd column is their number of independent insertion with 5^N bonus for N>1, 4th column is the number of independent insertion without the 5^N bonus.
*cutoff is used for filter out the independent insertions based on their own count which is the 3rd column of the input dataset
*pwd is the directory of Input/

QTCluster.py
Used to conduct Quality Threhold cluster method to genome position. Allow setting window size. It partition Experimental dataset into subclusters.
Input: txt format data, the output from Precutchr.py.
Output: 24 csv format files for 24 chromosomes with format â€œPosition,Cluster,Independent_Insertions_withBonus,Independent_Insertions,Chromosome".

Combine.py
Used to combine the Q-T clustered experimental data and the control data.
Input: the directory of QTcluster.py output
Output: One csv file,each row is one cluster, with format:
Chromosome
Cluster,
Start,  
Stop,  
BkgHop,
BkgHop_withBonus,  
ExpHop, 
ExpHop_withBonus


Simpletest.py
used to find subcluster has significant insertion due to SP1 transcripson.
Input: Combine csv which has all clustered information, and WT/combine.csv which gives us the total number of wild hops.
Output: One file with two P values for all the clusters.
        Header is
                Chromsome
                Total_WT_insertion
                Total_Exp_Insertion
                Start
                Stop
                P_value_from_Poission
                P_value_from_Hypergeomeric
                Exphop
                WThop

Annotated.py
Used for annotated Significant output. Find the closest gene and its trancription start, transcription end on both upstream and downs stream.
Input: the Significant insertion file, output of the Simpleteste.py
                   the refGene data with bed format which can be found at the Code file.
Ouput: the txt file of annotated significant insertions. Header is

' Chromosome, Total_WT_insertion, Total_Exp_Insertion, Start,Stop,P_value_from_Poission,Exphop,WThop,Closest_Upstream_Gene,CUTStart,CUTEnd,CUTstrand,Closest_Downstream_Gene,CDTStart,CDTEnd,CDTstrand'.
